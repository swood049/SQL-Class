# SQL-Class
The labs were in completion for my (Steven Woodard's) degree in Software Engineering. 
Those scripts are in conjunction with the data perscribed by my instructor for Introduction of SQL with the Oracle 12c: SQL textbook by Joan Casteel powered by Cengage


Note that these scripts are under copyright protection. If any user attempts to copy (steal) these scripts to give to a teacher as their 
own work, then after that user is caught for plagerism, I will sue that user for copyright infringement for the potential damaging my 
credability. I should be able to get your computer, gaming consoles, and car. So, think twice about stealing, and DO YOUR OWN WORK!
